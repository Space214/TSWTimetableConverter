For smaller timetables, simply copy and paste the unofficial editor timetable into the top textbox, then copy the output and paste it into the public editor.

For larger timetables use the .txt converter.
Make a new folder containing a file titled "timetable.txt". Inside this file paste in what you copied from the unofficial editor.
